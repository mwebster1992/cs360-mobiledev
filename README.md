In our final project, we were tasking with simulating a thermostat using the TI CC3220S Launchpad, a microcontroller unit.
Using the I2C to get the temperature from the built-in temperature sensor, we used GPIO to get input from two buttons that controlled increasing or decreasing 
the "set" temperature, and activated an led to simulate heating turning on and off in response.  We also used UART to 
write the current temperature, set temperature, and led status to the console window.
What I feel I did well was figure out the state machine logic.  Throughout the course, I have viewed the SM problems almost like fun
logic puzzles.  It is very cool to me to get to figure out how to implement the state machines to achieve the desired effect.
One area that I could definitely improve on is my technical reading; never before in a class have I had to read such dense
technical documents as we did on the TI Launchpad and its features.  While I am far from proficient in parsing the often jargon-heavy
documentation, it is a skill I want to develop and apply in the future.  I enjoyed the visual drawing of the systems I was working on
and will apply some of that to my future software developement planning processes.  As this program uses TI's built in libraries, any
changes should be automatically applied.  In terms of my custom functions, I tried to make them as minimal as possible to ensure that 
maintenance could be done quickly.  Overall, this class was the first in some time to feature coding that I actually enjoyed, and I am
grateful that I could be a part of it.
